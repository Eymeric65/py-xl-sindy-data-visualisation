\subsection*{Result}

\subsubsection*{New Unified SINDy catalog and experiment matrix}

We consider a mechanical system of $n$ generalised-coordinate $\mathbf{q}=(q_i)_{i=1}^n$, which conservative dynamics can be determined by a lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ and a set of non-conservative forces $(Q^{nc}_i)_{i=1}^n$ for each coordinate. The system is also externally excited by forces $(Q^{ext})_{i=1}^n$. Following Euler-lagrange the dynamics of our system can be written as a system of equation for each $i$ in $n$:

\begin{equation}
	Q^{ext}_i + Q^{nc}_i  = \frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q_i} 
	\label{eq:initial-dynamics}
\end{equation}

If we assume that the lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ expression is a linear combination of non linear candidate function :

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \sum_{k=1}^{m} c_k \xi_k(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}})
\end{equation}

and that each of the non-conservative force is a linear combination of non linear candidate function independant of the coordinate\footnote{coefficient is null on canditate function that are not present on other coordinate} :

\begin{equation}
	Q^{nc}_i = \sum_{k=1}^{p} b^i_k \phi_k(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},\ddot{\mathbf{q}})
\end{equation}

Thanks to the linearity of euler lagrange equation we can rewrite the initial system dynamics Eq.~\ref{eq:initial-dynamics} in the following form for each of the coordinate:

\begin{equation}
	\sum_{k=1}^{n} \delta_{ik} Q^{ext}_k + \sum_{k=1}^{p} b^i_k \phi_k  = \sum_{k=1}^{m} c_k \left( \frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{\partial \xi_k}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\right) - \frac{\partial \xi_k}{\partial q_i} \right) 
	\label{eq:UNI-system}
\end{equation}

By flattening the coefficient $(b^i_k)_{1 \le i \le n, \, 1 \le k \le p}$, we can obtain a classical SINDy coefficient vector :

\begin{equation}
	\Xi = \left[1,\dots,1 ,b^1_1,\dots,b^n_1,\dots,b^n_p,c_1,\dots,c_m\right]
\end{equation}
\noindent where $n$ successive $1$ are placed at the begining in order to account for the $Q^{ext}$ external forces term in our catalog. 

In the mean time we obtain the experiment matrix Fig.~\ref{fig:uni-sindy-matrix} that match our cofficient vector $\Xi$.

\subsection*{Result}

Detailed explanation on data generation and regression mode are in \cite{methods}.

The goal of the experiments we conducted is to show that UNI-SINDy get on par result with former SINDy method in each of their respective performance area, and also show that UNI-SINDy outperform old method on mixed passive active system. This latter kind of system ressemble more real robot that have passive part (typically in soft or under-actuaded robot) and active part.

We have divided the experiments in different group, in order to explicity compare UNI-SINDy in different area :
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{No damping explicit forces :} compare XL-SINdy with the new framework
	\item \textbf{Any damping explicit forces :} compare SINDy with the new framework
	\item \textbf{Any damping no forces :} compare SINDy-PI with the new framework
	\item \textbf{Any damping mixed implicit explicit forces : } show the versatility of the new UNI-SINDy when dealing with new type of experiment
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MATERIALS AND METHODS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Materials and Methods}

We introduce two new mechanisms onto the standard SINDy \cite{bruntonDiscoveringGoverningEquations2016} algorithm. The first one is the unified catalog. As explained in the introduction SINDy result are highly dependant on the quality of the catalog provided. While specialised catalog like Lagrange may fulfill highly specialised case study, it fails when faced with phenomenum it can not represent. The opposite is also true when using Newtonian catalogs, the general reach of the catalog enable the discovery of every type of dynamics but at the cost of large catalog that become a computational burden. Newton and Lagrange are however linked by the Euler-Lagrange equation, by leveraging this equation we were able to create a new unified experiment matrix where both paradigm are cooperating Figure.~\ref{fig:uni-sindy-matrix}. This can be futhermore extended to any paradigm that have such a translation equation. By using this new unified catalog and experiment matrix we are able to grasp a larger variety of dynamics while keeping the catalog size low.

The second mechanism that we introduce is the mixed implicit-explicit solving. From past studies we could execute system identification in explicit and implicit case separately, however when dealing with multiple coordinate system the nature of the system becomes ambiguous. We can ask ourself what is the implicit and explicit part in a system where we have input forces only on a subset of coordinates (a system composed of active and passive joint). We have thus developped an algorithm in order to determine during the regression process what could be the implicit and explicit part of the system. The algorithm is described in Figure.~\ref{fig:mixed_algorithm}.

\subsubsection*{Data generation and processing}

Our goal is to compare the performance of the new unified implicit-explit multi paradigm SINDy with the past Xl-SINDy, SINDy and SINDy-PI algorithms. We have compared these algorithms on three different systems: cartpole, cartpole double (double pendulum on a cartpole) and double pendulum. We have generated trajectory on these systems using a random harmonic input forces (sum of harmonic functions with random frequencies and amplitudes) that can be applied on every joint (fully explicit), on a subset of joints (mixed implicit-explicit) or no joint at all (implicit). In order to guarantee fair comparison between paradigm, we have guaranteed that input knowledge put inside the catalog determination is the same for every algorithm using this eurhistic : first we have generated the lagrangian catalog by doing polynomial expension on a set of base function $(sin(q_p),cos(q_p),q_p,\dot{q_p})_{p \in [1,..,n]}$. In order to find the equivalent Newtonian catalog, we have used euler-lagrange equation to translate every lagrangian term into its equivalent Newtonian term. Finally, with this set of function we have found the base functions that after the same polynomial expension lead to the minimal space containing the translated Lagrangian term. This algorithm guarantee that we grasp the compactnes of Lagrangian definition without giving a big handicap to Newton catalog. The lenght of every catalog on every system can be found Table.~\ref{table:catalog_lenght}. Every algorithms has been tested using the same regression algorithm : lasso regression for explicit part and \textsc{Clarabel} solver for implicit part. In order to test the noise resiliance of each algorithm we have run each algorithm on training data with increasing level of noise (normal noise added on every input data: position,velocity,acceleration,input forces).
In order to validate the result of each algorithm a validation trajectory is generated after each different regression and the retrieved system is compared against the ideal one.
Each algorithm has been tested on the same input data and has been evaluated on the same validations data. 

\subsubsection*{Implementation}

Since the new SINDy algorithm is an incremental improvement of past method, the fact that we reimplemented all the method in our library \textsc{py-xl-sindy}, have enabled us to compare each algorithm and catalog between each other on the same code base.
