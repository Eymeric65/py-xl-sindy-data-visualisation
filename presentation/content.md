# Description

The presentation is 15mn long. Aim for 15 canva

# Slide content

## EXTRA Lab specific slide

## Introduction
### 1: 1.1 Introduction

Just the start, what I will present, what people will learn and what will look like the result

### 2:  1.2 What is Sindy

Here I present what is Sindy. I make a story with a pendulum and I introduce the different way to predict the pendulum (Using AI and stuff). After I animate SINDy retrieving the pendulum

Notes : Takes at least 2 canvas

## 2 SINDY 
### 3: 2.1 What has been done in Sindy

Here I present the original SINDy, SINDy-PI and ENSEMBLE SINdy

### 4: 2.2 The lab SINDy

Here I present the Lagrangian and the Lab SINDy

### 5: 2.3 "My SINDy"

Here I present my work on SINDy what I added.

<!-- ## 6: 3 Entropy and input information

I release a bit the tension by doing a canva on entropy and information presenting phase portrait. -->

<!-- ## 7: 4 Implicit and explicit system
### 7: 4.1 Implicit and Explicit System 

I explain what is implicit and explicit system

### 8: 4.2 What implicit and explicit implies in Robotic ?

I open the canva of before, to robotic discussion only  -->

### 9: 4.3 A mixed Implicit and explicit framework tailored to robotic

I explain my algorithm how does it work and why it solves the issue 

## 10: 5 Results
### 10: 5.1 Result content

I explain what did I do and what is going to be shown later

### 11: 5.2 Precise result shown 

I show precise result on the different system

### 12: 5.3 Global results

I show the table with all the result and explain why my method perform better 

## 13: 6 Future works
### 13: 6.1 Next works

Go into the reality try on a robot

### 14: 6.2 Conclusion
Comclude on my addition to the SINDy world and wrap up everything

### 15: 7. QA time
QA time.

# Notes 

15 canvas. 

7 doesn t need animation.
8 are hard to do.

# Schedule until 18 November

11 November : did 1 hard and one easy.

left : 6 easy and 7 hard.
