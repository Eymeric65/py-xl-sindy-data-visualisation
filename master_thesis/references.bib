  abstract = {The ability to discover physical laws and governing equations from data is one of humankind's greatest intellectual achievements. A quantitative understanding of dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled advanced technological achievements, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing physical equations from measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized, time-varying, or externally forced systems.},

In contrast to neural-network-based methods, these methods are designed to obtain white-box analytical models. In this work, we incorporate the concept of SINDy and knowledge in the field of classical mechanics to identify interpretable and sparse expressions of total energy and the Lagrangian that shelters the hidden dynamics. Moreover, our method (hereafter referred as Lagrangian-SINDy) is developed to use knowledge of simple systems that form the system being analyzed to ensure the likelihood of correct results and to improve the learning pace. Lagrangian-SINDy is highly accurate in discovering interpretable dynamics via energy-related physical quantities. Its performance is validated with three popular multi-DOF nonlinear dynamical systems, namely the spherical pendulum, double pendulum and cart-pendulum system. Comparisons with other SINDy-based methods are made and Lagrangian-SINDy is found to provide the most compact analytical models.},

  abstract = {Accurate models of the world are built upon notions of its underlying symmetries. In physics, these symmetries correspond to conservation laws, such as for energy and momentum. Yet even though neural network models see increasing use in the physical sciences, they struggle to learn these symmetries. In this paper, we propose Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), which can parameterize arbitrary Lagrangians using neural networks. In contrast to models that learn Hamiltonians, LNNs do not require canonical coordinates, and thus perform well in situations where canonical momenta are unknown or difficult to compute. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not restrict the functional form of learned energies and will produce energy-conserving models for a variety of tasks. We test our approach on a double pendulum and a relativistic particle, demonstrating energy conservation where a baseline approach incurs dissipation and modeling relativity without canonical coordinates where a Hamiltonian approach fails. Finally, we show how this model can be applied to graphs and continuous systems using a Lagrangian Graph Network, and demonstrate it on the 1D wave equation.},

  abstract = {Sparse model identification enables the discovery of nonlinear dynamical systems purely from data; however, this approach is sensitive to noise, especially in the low-data limit. In this work, we leverage the statistical approach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to several synthetic and real-world data sets and demonstrate substantial improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected from 1900-1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be exploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.},

  abstract = {The theoretical development of the laws of motion of bodies is a problem of such interest and importance, that it has engaged the attention of all the most eminent mathematicians, since the invention of dynamics as a mathematical science by Galileo, and especially since the wonderful extension which was given to that science by Newton. Among the successors of those illustrious men, Lagrange has perhaps done more than any other analyst, to give extent and harmony to such deductive researches, by showing that the most varied consequences respecting the motions of systems of bodies may be derived from one radical formula; the beauty of the method so suiting the dignity of the results, as to make of his great work a kind of scientific poem. But the science of force, or of power acting by law in space and time, has undergone already another revolution, and has become already more dynamic, by having almost dismissed the conceptions of solidity and cohesion, and those other material ties, or geometrically imaginable conditions, which Lagrange so happily reasoned on, and by tending more and more to resolve all connexions and actions of bodies into attractions and repulsions of points: and while the science is advancing thus in one direction by the improvement of physical views, it may advance in another direction also by the invention of mathematical methods. And the method proposed in the present essay, for the deductive study of the motions of attracting or repelling systems, will perhaps be received with indulgence, as an attempt to assist in carrying forward so high an inquiry. In the methods commonly employed, the determination of the motion of a free point in space, under the influence of accelerating forces, depends on the integration of three equations in ordinary differentials of the second order; and the determination of the motions of a system of free points, attracting or repelling one another, depends on the integration of a system of such equations, in number threefold the number of the attracting or repelling points, unless we previously diminish by unity this latter number, by considering only relative motions. Thus, in the solar system, when we consider only the mutual attractions of the sun and of the ten known planets, the determination of the motions of the latter about the former is reduced, by the usual methods, to the integration of a system of thirty ordinary differential equations of the second order, between the coordinates and the time; or, by a transformation of Lagrange, to the integration of a system of sixty ordinary differential equations of the first order, between the time and the elliptic elements: by which integrations, the thirty varying coordinates, or the sixty varying elements, are to be found as functions of the time. In the method of the present essay, this problem is reduced to the search and differentiation of a single function, which satisfies two partial differential equations of the first order and of the second degree: and every other dynamical problem, respecting the motions of any system, however numerous, of attracting or repelling points, (even if we suppose those points restricted by any conditions of connexion consistent with the law of living force,) is reduced, in like manner, to the study of one central function, of which the form marks out and characterizes the properties of the moving system, and is to be determined by a pair of partial differential equations of the first order, combined with some simple considerations. The difficulty is therefore at least transferred from the integration of many equations of one class to the integration of two of another: and even if it should be thought that no practical facility is gained, yet an intellectual pleasure may result from the reduction of the most complex and, probably., of all researches respecting the forces and motions of body, to the study of one characteristic function, the unfolding of one central relation.},

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov--Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.},

  abstract = {The data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is currently pushing the frontiers of modeling and control efforts, and it provides a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control. However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks, require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and often do not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit the use of these techniques for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modeling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of model predictive control (MPC), based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable, generalizable, and reducing the burden of training data. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than neural network models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid changes to the system. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.},

However, it is challenging to characterize, much less guarantee, the global stability (i.e., long-time boundedness) of these models. Previous work provided a theorem outlining necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure global stability in systems with energy-preserving, quadratic nonlinearities, with the goal of evaluating the stability of projection-based models. In this work, we incorporate this theorem into modern data-driven models obtained via machine learning. First, we propose that this theorem should be a standard diagnostic for the stability of projection-based and data-driven models, examining the conditions under which it holds. Second, we illustrate how to modify the objective function in machine learning algorithms to promote globally stable models, with implications for the modeling of fluid and plasma flows. Specifically, we introduce a modified ``trapping SINDy'' algorithm based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method. This method enables the identification of models that, by construction, only produce bounded trajectories. The effectiveness and accuracy of this approach are demonstrated on a broad set of examples of varying model complexity and physical origin, including the vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder.},

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has achieved astonishing results on many tasks with large amounts of data and generalization within the proximity of training data. For many important real-world applications, these requirements are unfeasible and additional prior knowledge on the task domain is required to overcome the resulting problems. In particular, learning physics models for model-based control requires robust extrapolation from fewer samples - often collected online in real-time - and model errors may lead to drastic damages of the system. Directly incorporating physical insight has enabled us to obtain a novel deep model learning approach that extrapolates well while requiring fewer samples. As a first example, we propose Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) as a deep network structure upon which Lagrangian Mechanics have been imposed. DeLaN can learn the equations of motion of a mechanical system (i.e., system dynamics) with a deep network efficiently while ensuring physical plausibility. The resulting DeLaN network performs very well at robot tracking control. The proposed method did not only outperform previous model learning approaches at learning speed but exhibits substantially improved and more robust extrapolation to novel trajectories and learns online in real-time}

This paper proposes a novel type of function learning network, called equation learner (EQL), that can learn analytical expressions and is able to extrapolate to unseen domains. It is implemented as an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward network and allows for efficient gradient based training. Due to sparsity regularization concise interpretable expressions can be obtained. Often the true underlying source expression is identified.},

Using symbolic regression and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), we recover compact closed-form expressions for this residual from joint-space data. In simulation on a 7-DoF Franka arm with known dynamics, these interpretable models accurately recover inertial, Coriolis, gravity, and viscous effects with very small relative error and outperform neural-network baselines in both accuracy and generalization. On real data from a 7-DoF WAM arm, symbolic-regression residuals generalize substantially better than SINDy and neural networks, which tend to overfit, and suggest candidate new closed-form formulations that extend the nominal dynamics model for this robot. Overall, the results indicate that interpretable residual dynamics models provide compact, accurate, and physically meaningful alternatives to black-box function approximators for torque prediction.},

  abstract = {This research proposes a novel approach for the residual modeling of inverse dynamics employed to control a real robotic device. Specifically, we use techniques based on linear regression for residual modeling while a nominal model is discovered by physics-informed neural networks such as the Lagrangian Neural Network and the Feedforward Neural Network. We introduce an efficient online learning mechanism for the residual models that utilizes rank-one updates based on the Sherman--Morrison formula. This enables faster adaptation and updates to effects not captured by the neural networks. While the time complexity of updating the model is comparable to other successful learning methods, the method excels in prediction complexity, which depends solely on the model dimension. We propose two online learning strategies: a weighted approach that gradually diminishes the influence of past measurements on the model, and a windowed approach that sharply excludes the oldest data from impacting the model. We explore the relationship between these strategies, offering recommendations for parameter selection and practical application. Special attention is given to optimizing the computation time of the weighted approach when recomputation techniques are implemented, which results in comparable or even lower execution times of the weighted controller than the windowed one. Additionally, we assess other methods, such as the Woodbury identity, QR decomposition, and Cholesky decomposition, which can be implicitly used to update the model. We empirically validate our approach using real data from a 2-degrees-of-freedom flexible manipulator, demonstrating consistent improvements in feedforward controller performance.},

  abstract = {The autonomous distillation of physical laws only from data is of great interest in many scientific fields. Data-driven modeling frameworks that adopt sparse regression techniques, such as sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) and its modifications, are developed to resolve difficulties in extracting underlying dynamics from experimental data. However, SINDy faces certain difficulties when the dynamics contain rational functions. The Lagrangian is substantially more concise than the actual equations of motion, especially for complex systems, and it does not usually contain rational functions for mechanical systems. Few proposed methods proposed to date, such as Lagrangian-SINDy we have proposed recently, can extract the true form of the Lagrangian of dynamical systems from data; however, these methods are easily affected by noise as a fact. In this study, we developed an extended version of Lagrangian-SINDy (xL-SINDy) to obtain the Lagrangian of dynamical systems from noisy measurement data. We incorporated the concept of SINDy and used the proximal gradient method to obtain sparse Lagrangian expressions. Further, we demonstrated the effectiveness of xL-SINDy against different noise levels using four mechanical systems. In addition, we compared its performance with SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit) which is a latest robust variant of SINDy that can handle implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The experimental results reveal that xL-SINDy is much more robust than the existing methods for extracting the governing equations of nonlinear mechanical systems from data with noise. We believe this contribution is significant toward noise-tolerant computational method for explicit dynamics law extraction from data.},

Accurate models are essential for NMPC to effectively control complex nonlinear systems, especially over long prediction horizons. Traditional modeling based on first principles often suffers from uncertainties and human errors, leading to insufficient accuracy for precise trajectory tracking in quadrotor UAVs. The SINDy algorithm provides the solution to this problem further expanding the use of NMPC by learning accurate parsimonious nonlinear models of complex dynamics with lots of model uncertainties. The SINDy algorithm reveals the most significant terms in the equations of motion and provides a reduced-order model suitable for real-time control. The identified model is then utilized in an NMPC framework to optimize the quadrotor's trajectory while respecting state and input constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SINDy-MPC approach in accurately modeling the quadrotor dynamics even in the presence of uncertainties and noisy data, achieving precise trajectory tracking on long prediction horizons.},

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the ``alphabet'' used to describe those systems.}

  abstract = {Controlling a robot based on physics-consistent dynamic models, such as Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments, the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable, particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as model predictive control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system identification, and integrate it with an MPC for adaptive, physics-consistent control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39\%, compared to a 21\% improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.},

  abstract = {Accurately modeling nonlinear dynamic systems remains a significant challenge across numerous scientific fields, from physics to finance. Existing methods require prior knowledge of the system or are sensitive to noise, making them impractical to handle real-world tasks. Based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, our previous research proposed a variant of the SINDy algorithm. With the Lagrangian integrated, we named our method extended Lagrangian-SINDy (xL-SINDy). The xL-SINDy shows higher robustness than the competing method with a factor of 100, but it sacrifices the ability to deal with a nonconservative system. This paper introduces a new method that extends xL-SINDy's capabilities. We address its primary limitation by integrating the Rayleigh dissipation function into the xL-SINDy framework. Tests on four different pendulum systems show that our method maintains the same level of robustness as the xL-SINDy, but can identify nonconservative terms in the system. Making it better describe the real-world systems. While the proposed method is limited to specific types of dissipative forces that the Rayleigh dissipation can describe, the provided framework can be extended to include any form of the nonconservative terms.},

  abstract = {One way to understand time-series data is to identify the underlying dynamical system which generates it. This task can be done by selecting an appropriate model and a set of parameters which best fits the dynamics while providing the simplest representation (i.e., the smallest amount of terms). One such approach is the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics framework [6], which uses a sparsity-promoting algorithm that iterates between a partial least-squares fit and a thresholding (sparsity-promoting) step. In this work, we provide some theoretical results on the behavior and convergence of the algorithm proposed in [S. L. Brunton, J. L. Proctor, and J. N. Kutz, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 113 (2016), pp. 3932--3937]. In particular, we prove that the algorithm approximates local minimizers of an unconstrained \$\textbackslash ell\textasciicircum 0\$-penalized least-squares problem. From this, we provide sufficient conditions for general convergence, rate of convergence, conditions for one-step recovery, and a recovery result with respect to the condition number and noise. Examples illustrate that the rates of convergence are sharp. In addition, our results extend to other algorithms related to the algorithm in [S. L. Brunton, J. L. Proctor, and J. N. Kutz, Proc. Nat.

However, these algorithms require an abundance of training examples and may become prohibitively expensive for many applications. In addition, the reliance on deep neural networks often results in an uninterpretable, black-box policy that may be too computationally expensive to use with certain embedded systems. Recent advances in sparse dictionary learning, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), have shown promise for creating efficient and interpretable data-driven models in the low-data regime. In this work we introduce SINDy-RL, a unifying framework for combining SINDy and DRL to create efficient, interpretable, and trustworthy representations of the dynamics model, reward function, and control policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on benchmark control environments and challenging fluids problems. SINDy-RL achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL algorithms using significantly fewer interactions in the environment and results in an interpretable control policy orders of magnitude smaller than a deep neural network policy.},
